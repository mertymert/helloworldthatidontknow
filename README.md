journey of me being #1 programmer in the world
I am a dummy who is trying to learn some coding. By doing that I think that I will be rich which makes me even dummier....I guess, We will see.
If I be rich because of coding and stuff, I will buy everyone a Cola. 
Help me out for free Coke guys. Thanks.
